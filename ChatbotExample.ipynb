same\\nsecond nature.', 'by proper shelter and clothing we legitimately retain\\nour own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of fuel, that\\nis, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not\\ncookery properly be said to begin?', 'darwin, the naturalist, says of the\\ninhabitants of tierra del fuego, that while his own party, who were well\\nclothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these naked\\nsavages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great surprise, \"to\\nbe streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting.\"', 'so,

civilized man?', \"according\\nto liebig, man's body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps up the\\ninternal combustion in the lungs.\", 'in cold weather we eat more, in warm\\nless.', 'the animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease\\nand death take place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or\\nfrom some defect in the draught, the fire goes out.', 'of course the vital\\nheat is not to be confounded with fire; but so much for analogy.', 'it\\nappears, therefore, from the above list, that the expression, animal\\nlife, is nearly synonymous with the expression, animal heat; for while\\nfood may be regarded as the fuel which keeps up the fire within us--and\\nfuel serves only to prepare that food or to increase the warmth of our\\nbodies by addition from without--shelter and clothing also serve only to\\nretain the heat thus generated and absorbed.', 'the grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep\\nthe vital heat in us.', 'what pains we accordingly take, not only with\\nour food, and clothing, and shelter, but with our beds, which are our\\nnight-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this\\nshelter

fire, and many of the fruits are\\nsufficiently cooked by its rays; while food generally is more various,\\nand more easily obtained, and clothing and shelter are wholly or half\\nunnecessary.', 'at the present day, and in this country, as i find by\\nmy own experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a\\nwheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and\\naccess to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be obtained\\nat a trifling cost.', 'yet some, not wise, go to the other side of the\\nglobe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves to\\ntrade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live--that is,\\nkeep comfortably warm--and die in new england at last.', 'the luxuriously\\nrich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as i\\nimplied before, they are cooked, of course a la mode.', 'most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are\\nnot only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation\\nof mankind.', 'with respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have\\never lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.', 'the ancient\\nphilosophers,

nations?', 'are we sure\\nthat there is none of it in our own lives?', 'the philosopher is in\\nadvance of his age even in the outward form of his life.', 'he is not fed,\\nsheltered, clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries.', 'how can a man be a\\nphilosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other\\nmen?', 'when a man is warmed by the several modes which i have described,

hotter fires, and the like.', 'when he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is\\nanother alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to\\nadventure on life now,

'why\\nhas man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in\\nthe same proportion into the heavens above?--for the nobler plants are\\nvalued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from\\nthe ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which,\\nthough they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have\\nperfected their root, and often cut down at top for this purpose, so\\nthat most would not know them in their flowering season.', 'i do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who will\\nmind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance build\\nmore magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest, without\\never impoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live--if, indeed,\\nthere are any

would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat\\nacquainted with its actual history; it would certainly astonish those\\nwho know nothing about it.', 'i will only hint at some of the enterprises\\nwhich i have cherished.', 'in any weather, at any hour of the day or night, i have been anxious to\\nimprove the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the\\nmeeting of

nearer to some of those which\\ncommonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and\\nmore thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade\\na villager--the wood

was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like\\nthe rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon.', 'for the first\\nweek, whenever i looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high\\nup on the side of a mountain, its bottom far above the surface of other\\nlakes, and, as the sun arose, i saw it throwing off its nightly clothing\\nof mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth\\nreflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were\\nstealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the\\nbreaking up of some nocturnal conventicle.', 'the very dew seemed to\\nhang upon the trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of\\nmountains.', 'this small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a\\ngentle rain-storm in august, when, both air and water being perfectly\\nstill, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of\\nevening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to\\nshore.', 'a lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the\\nclear portion of the air above it being, shallow and darkened by clouds,\\nthe water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself\\nso much the more important.', 'from a hill-top near by, where the wood had\\nbeen recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across\\nthe pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore\\nthere, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a\\nstream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream\\nthere was none.', 'that way i looked between and over the near green\\nhills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue.',

also of\\nsome portion of the village.\", 'but in other directions, even from this\\npoint, i could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me.', 'it\\nis well to have some water in your

important as that it keeps butter cool.', 'when i looked across the\\npond from this peak toward the sudbury meadows, which in time of flood\\ni distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley,\\nlike a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like\\na thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of\\ninterverting water, and i was reminded that

find its\\nway home if its master should forsake it, as the hand finds its way to\\nthe mouth without assistance.', 'several times, when a visitor chanced to\\nstay into evening, and it proved a dark night, i was obliged to conduct\\nhim to the cart-path in the rear of the house, and then point out to him\\nthe direction he was to pursue, and in keeping which he was to be guided\\nrather by his feet than his eyes.', 'one very dark night i directed thus\\non their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond.', 'they lived\\nabout a mile off through the woods, and were quite used to the

night; and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile\\nout of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not\\nknowing when they turned.', 'it is a surprising and

vale and hillside.', 'in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and\\nsaw the perch, which i seem to have charmed, hovering around me, and\\nthe moon travelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the\\nwrecks of the forest.', \"formerly i had come to this pond adventurously,\\nfrom time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion, and, making\\na fire close to the water's edge, which we thought attracted the fishes,\\nwe caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread, and when we\\nhad done, far in the night, threw the burning brands high into the

bird close at hand.\", 'these experiences\\nwere very memorable and valuable to me--anchored in forty feet of\\nwater, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes\\nby thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with their\\ntails in the moonlight, and communicating by a long flaxen line with\\nmysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below,\\nor sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as i drifted in\\nthe gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight vibration along\\nit, indicative of some life prowling about its extremity, of dull\\nuncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to make up its mind.', 'at length you slowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some horned pout\\nsqueaking and squirming to the upper air.', 'it was very queer, especially\\nin dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal\\nthemes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk, which came to\\ninterrupt your

fishes as\\nit were with one hook.', 'the scenery of walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful,\\ndoes not approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not\\nlong frequented it or lived by its shore; yet this pond is so remarkable\\nfor its depth and purity as to merit a particular description.', 'it is\\na clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a mile and three\\nquarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one and a half\\nacres; a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods, without\\nany visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation.', 'the\\nsurrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the height of forty to\\neighty feet, though on the southeast and east they attain to about one\\nhundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively, within a quarter\\nand a third of a mile.', 'they are exclusively woodland.', 'all our concord\\nwaters have two colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and\\nanother, more proper, close at hand.', 'the first depends more on the\\nlight, and follows the sky.', 'in clear weather, in summer, they appear\\nblue at a little distance, especially if agitated, and at a great\\ndistance all appear alike.', 'in stormy weather they are sometimes of a\\ndark slate-color.', 'the sea, however, is said to be blue one day and green\\nanother without any perceptible change in the atmosphere.', 'i have seen\\nour river, when, the landscape being covered with snow, both water and\\nice were almost as green as grass.', 'some consider blue \"to be the color\\nof pure water, whether liquid or solid.\"', 'but, looking directly down into\\nour waters from a boat, they are seen to be of very different colors.', 'walden is blue at one time and green at another, even from the same\\npoint of view.', 'lying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of\\nthe color of both.', 'viewed from a hilltop it reflects the color of the\\nsky; but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where\\nyou can see the sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a\\nuniform dark green in the body of the pond.', 'in some lights, viewed\\neven from a hilltop, it is of a vivid green next the shore.', 'some have\\nreferred this to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green\\nthere against the railroad sandbank, and in the spring, before the\\nleaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing\\nblue mixed with the yellow of the sand.', 'such is the color of its iris.', 'this is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed\\nby the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted\\nthrough the earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still\\nfrozen middle.', 'like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear\\nweather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the\\nright angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears\\nat a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such\\na time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to\\nsee the reflection, i have discerned a matchless and indescribable light\\nblue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest, more\\ncerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark green\\non the opposite sides of the waves, which last appeared but muddy in\\ncomparison.', 'it is a vitreous greenish blue, as i remember it, like those\\npatches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before\\nsundown.', 'yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as\\ncolorless as an equal quantity of air.', 'it is well known that a large\\nplate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the makers say, to its\\n\"body,\" but a small piece of the same will be colorless.', 'how large a\\nbody of walden water would be required to reflect a green tint i have\\nnever proved.', 'the water of our river is black or a very dark brown to\\none looking directly down on it, and, like that of most ponds, imparts\\nto the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge; but this water is\\nof such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an\\nalabaster whiteness, still more unnatural, which, as the limbs are\\nmagnified and distorted withal, produces a monstrous effect, making fit\\nstudies for a michael angelo.', 'the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at\\nthe depth of twenty-five or thirty feet.', 'paddling over it, you may see,\\nmany feet beneath the surface, the schools of perch and shiners,\\nperhaps only an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their\\ntransverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find\\na subsistence there.', 'once, in the winter, many years ago, when i had\\nbeen cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as i\\nstepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil\\ngenius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of\\nthe holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep.', 'out of curiosity,\\ni lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until i saw the axe\\na little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and\\ngently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it\\nmight have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle\\nrotted off, if i had not disturbed it.', 'making another hole directly over\\nit with an ice chisel which i had, and cutting down the longest\\nbirch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife, i made a\\nslip-noose, which i attached to its end, and, letting it down carefully,\\npassed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the\\nbirch, and so pulled the axe out again.', 'the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like\\npaving-stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep\\nthat in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your\\nhead; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be the\\nlast to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.', 'some\\nthink it is bottomless.', 'it is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer would\\nsay that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable plants,\\nexcept in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not properly\\nbelong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush,\\nnor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small heart-leaves and\\npotamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all which however a\\nbather might not perceive; and these plants are clean and bright like\\nthe element they grow in.', 'the stones extend a rod or two into the water,\\nand then the bottom is pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where\\nthere is usually a little sediment, probably from the decay of the\\nleaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls, and a\\nbright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter.', 'we have one other pond just like this, white pond, in nine acre corner,\\nabout two and a half miles westerly; but, though i am acquainted with\\nmost of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know a\\nthird of this pure and well-like character.', 'successive nations perchance\\nhave drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its\\nwater is green and pellucid as ever.', 'not an intermitting spring!', 'perhaps\\non that spring morning when adam and eve were driven out of eden walden\\npond was already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle\\nspring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with\\nmyriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall, when still\\nsuch pure lakes sufficed them.', 'even then it had commenced to rise and\\nfall, and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now\\nwear, and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only walden pond in\\nthe world and distiller of celestial dews.', \"who knows in how many\\nunremembered nations' literatures this has been the castalian fountain?\", 'or what nymphs presided over it in the golden age?', 'it is a gem of the\\nfirst water which concord wears in her coronet.', 'yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of\\ntheir footsteps.', \"i have been surprised to detect encircling the pond,\\neven where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow\\nshelf-like path in the steep hillside, alternately rising and falling,\\napproaching and receding from the water's edge, as old probably as the\\nrace of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still from\\ntime to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land.\", 'this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond\\nin winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a clear\\nundulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very obvious\\na quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly\\ndistinguishable close at hand.', 'the snow reprints it, as it were, in\\nclear white type alto-relievo.', 'the ornamented grounds of villas which\\nwill one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.', 'the pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what\\nperiod, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know.', 'it is\\ncommonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer, though not\\ncorresponding to the general wet and dryness.', 'i can remember when it\\nwas a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet higher,\\nthan when i lived by it.', 'there is a narrow sand-bar running into it,\\nwith very deep water on one side, on which i helped boil a kettle of\\nchowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year 1824, which\\nit has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and, on the other\\nhand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them, that\\na few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded\\ncove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which\\nplace was long since converted into a meadow.', \"but the pond has risen\\nsteadily for two years, and now, in the summer of '52, is just five feet\\nhigher than when i lived there, or as high as it was thirty years ago,\\nand fishing goes on again in the meadow.\", 'this makes a difference of\\nlevel, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the water shed by\\nthe surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and this overflow must\\nbe referred to causes which affect the deep springs.', 'this same\\nsummer the pond has begun to fall again.', 'it is remarkable that this\\nfluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to require many\\nyears for its accomplishment.', 'i have observed one rise and a part of two\\nfalls, and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will\\nagain be as low as i have ever known it.', \"flint's pond, a mile eastward,\\nallowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets,\\nand the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with walden, and\\nrecently attained their greatest height at the same time with the\\nlatter.\", 'the same is true, as far as my observation goes, of white pond.', 'this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use at least;\\nthe water standing at this great height for a year or more, though it\\nmakes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and trees which\\nhave sprung up about its edge since the last rise--pitch pines, birches,\\nalders, aspens, and others--and, falling again, leaves an unobstructed\\nshore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a\\ndaily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest.', 'on the side\\nof the pond next my house a row of pitch pines, fifteen feet high, has\\nbeen killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and thus a stop put\\nto their encroachments; and their size indicates how many years have\\nelapsed since the last rise to this height.', 'by this fluctuation the pond\\nasserts its title to a shore, and thus the shore is shorn, and the trees\\ncannot hold it by right of possession.', 'these are the lips of the lake,\\non which no beard grows.', 'it licks its chaps from time to time.', 'when the\\nwater is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a\\nmass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their\\nstems in the water, and to the height of three or four feet from the\\nground, in the effort to maintain themselves; and i have known the high\\nblueberry bushes about the shore, which commonly produce no fruit, bear\\nan abundant crop under these circumstances.', 'some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved.', 'my townsmen have all heard the tradition--the oldest people tell me that\\nthey heard it in their youth--that anciently the indians were holding\\na pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens as the\\npond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much profanity, as\\nthe story goes, though this vice is one of which the indians were never\\nguilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly\\nsank, and only one old squaw, named walden, escaped, and from her the\\npond was named.', 'it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these\\nstones rolled down its side and became the present shore.', 'it is very\\ncertain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here, and now there\\nis one; and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the\\naccount of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned, who remembers\\nso well when he first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor\\nrising from the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he\\nconcluded to dig a well here.', 'as for the stones, many still think that\\nthey are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these\\nhills; but i observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of\\nthe same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them\\nup in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and,\\nmoreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so that,\\nunfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me.', 'i detect the paver.', 'if\\nthe name was not derived from that of some english locality--saffron\\nwalden, for instance--one might suppose that it was called originally\\nwalled-in pond.', 'the pond was my well ready dug.', 'for four months in the year its water is\\nas cold as it is pure at all times; and i think that it is then as good\\nas any, if not the best, in the town.', 'in the winter, all water which is\\nexposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are protected\\nfrom it.', \"the temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room\\nwhere i sat from five o'clock in the afternoon till noon the next day,\\nthe sixth of march, 1846, the thermometer having been up to 65x or 70x\\nsome of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42x, or one\\ndegree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village\\njust drawn.\", 'the temperature of the boiling spring the same day was 45x,\\nor the warmest of any water tried, though it is the coldest that i know\\nof in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not\\nmingled with it.', 'moreover, in summer, walden never becomes so warm as\\nmost water which is exposed to the sun, on account of its depth.', 'in the\\nwarmest weather i usually placed a pailful in my cellar, where it\\nbecame cool in the night, and remained so during the day; though i also\\nresorted to a spring in the neighborhood.', 'it was as good when a week old\\nas the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the pump.', 'whoever camps\\nfor a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury a pail of\\nwater a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the\\nluxury of ice.', 'there have been caught in walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds--to\\nsay nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity,\\nwhich the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did\\nnot see him--perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds,\\nshiners, chivins or roach (leuciscus pulchellus), a very few breams, and\\na couple of eels, one weighing four pounds--i am thus particular because\\nthe weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and these are\\nthe only eels i have heard of here;--also, i have a faint recollection\\nof a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides and a\\ngreenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which i mention here\\nchiefly to link my facts to fable.', 'nevertheless, this pond is not very\\nfertile in fish.', 'its pickerel, though not abundant, are its chief boast.', 'i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three\\ndifferent kinds: a long and shallow one, steel-colored, most like those\\ncaught in the river; a bright golden kind, with greenish reflections\\nand remarkably deep, which is the most common here; and another,\\ngolden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides with\\nsmall dark brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red\\nones, very much like a trout.', 'the specific name reticulatus would not\\napply to this; it should be guttatus rather.', 'these are all very firm\\nfish, and weigh more than their size promises.', 'the shiners, pouts, and\\nperch also, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much\\ncleaner, handsomer, and firmer-fleshed than those in the river and most\\nother ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be distinguished\\nfrom them.', 'probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some\\nof them.', 'there are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a\\nfew mussels in it; muskrats and minks leave their traces about it, and\\noccasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it.', 'sometimes, when i pushed\\noff my boat in the morning, i disturbed a great mud-turtle which had\\nsecreted himself under the boat in the night.', 'ducks and geese frequent\\nit in the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows (hirundo bicolor)\\nskim over it, and the peetweets (totanus macularius) \"teeter\" along its\\nstony shores all summer.', 'i have sometimes disturbed a fish hawk sitting\\non a white pine over the water; but i doubt if it is ever profaned by\\nthe wind of a gull, like fair haven.', 'at most, it tolerates one annual\\nloon.', 'these are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.', \"you may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore,\\nwhere the water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts\\nof the pond, some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot\\nin height, consisting of small stones less than a hen's egg in size,\\nwhere all around is bare sand.\", 'at first you wonder if the indians\\ncould have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice\\nmelted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of\\nthem plainly too fresh for that.', 'they are similar to those found in\\nrivers; but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here, i know not by\\nwhat fish they could be made.', 'perhaps they are the nests of the chivin.', 'these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.', 'the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous.', \"i have in my mind's\\neye the western, indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the\\nbeautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap\\neach other and suggest unexplored coves between.\", \"the forest has never\\nso good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from the\\nmiddle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water's edge; for\\nthe water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in\\nsuch a case, but, with its winding shore, the most natural and agreeable\\nboundary to it.\", 'there is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there,\\nas where the axe has cleared a part, or a cultivated field abuts on it.', 'the trees have ample room to expand on the water side, and each sends\\nforth its most vigorous branch in that direction.', 'there nature has woven\\na natural selvage, and the eye rises by just gradations from the low\\nshrubs of the shore to the highest trees.', \"there are

are\\nits overhanging brows.', 'standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in\\na calm september afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite\\nshore-line indistinct, i have seen whence came the expression, \"the\\nglassy surface of a lake.\"', 'when you invert your head, it looks like\\na thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming\\nagainst the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere\\nfrom another.', 'you would think that you could walk dry under it to the\\nopposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it.', 'indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as it were by mistake, and\\nare undeceived.', 'as you look over the pond westward you are obliged to\\nemploy both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well\\nas the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the two,\\nyou survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as glass,\\nexcept where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered over its\\nwhole extent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable\\nsparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as i have said,\\na swallow skims so low as to touch it.', 'it may be that in the distance a\\nfish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and there is one\\nbright flash where it emerges, and another where it strikes the water;\\nsometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed; or here and there, perhaps,\\nis a thistle-down floating on its surface, which the fishes dart at and\\nso dimple it again.', 'it is like molten glass cooled but not congealed,\\nand the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in\\nglass.', 'you may often detect a yet smoother and darker water, separated\\nfrom the rest as if by an invisible cobweb, boom of the water nymphs,\\nresting on it.', 'from a hilltop you can see a fish leap in almost any\\npart; for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth\\nsurface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake.', 'it is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is\\nadvertised--this piscine murder will out--and from my distant perch i\\ndistinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods\\nin diameter.', 'you can even detect a water-bug (gyrinus) ceaselessly\\nprogressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a mile off; for they\\nfurrow the water slightly, making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two\\ndiverging lines, but the skaters glide over it without rippling it\\nperceptibly.', 'when the surface is considerably agitated there are no\\nskaters nor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in calm days, they leave\\ntheir havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short\\nimpulses till they completely cover it.', 'it is a soothing employment,\\non one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun\\nis fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on such a height as this,\\noverlooking the pond, and study the dimpling circles which are\\nincessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the\\nreflected skies and trees.',

over it.', 'the skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of\\noctober, when the severe frosts have come; and then and in november,\\nusually, in a calm day, there is absolutely nothing to ripple the\\nsurface.', \"one november afternoon, in the calm at the end of a rain-storm\\nof several days' duration, when the sky was still completely overcast\\nand the air was full of

november\\ncolors of the surrounding hills.\", 'though i passed over it as gently as\\npossible, the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost\\nas far as i could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections.', 'but, as i was looking over the surface, i saw here and there at a\\ndistance a faint glimmer, as if some skater insects which had escaped\\nthe frosts might be collected there, or, perchance, the surface, being\\nso smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom.', 'paddling\\ngently to one of these places, i was surprised to find myself surrounded\\nby myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of a rich bronze\\ncolor in the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to\\nthe surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it.', 'in such\\ntransparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the clouds,\\ni seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and their\\nswimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were\\na compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or\\nleft, their fins, like sails, set all around them.', 'there were many such\\nschools in the pond, apparently improving the short season before winter\\nwould draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight, sometimes giving\\nto the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it, or a few\\nrain-drops fell there.', 'when i approached carelessly and alarmed them,\\nthey made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if one had\\nstruck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly took refuge in the\\ndepths.', 'at length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began\\nto run, and the perch leaped much higher than before, half out of water,\\na hundred black

the\\nair being fun of mist, i made haste to take my place at the oars and row\\nhomeward; already the rain seemed rapidly increasing, though i felt\\nnone on my cheek, and i anticipated a thorough soaking.', 'but suddenly the\\ndimples ceased, for they were produced by the perch, which the noise\\nof my oars had seared into the depths, and i saw their schools dimly\\ndisappearing; so i spent a dry afternoon after all.', 'an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when\\nit was dark with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he\\nsometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water-fowl, and that\\nthere were many eagles about it.', 'he came here a-fishing, and used an\\nold log canoe which he found on the shore.', 'it was made of two white pine\\nlogs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at the ends.', 'it was very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it became\\nwater-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom.', 'he did not know whose it\\nwas; it belonged to the pond.', 'he used to make a cable for his anchor of\\nstrips of hickory bark tied together.', 'an old man, a potter, who lived\\nby the pond before the revolution, told him once that there was an iron\\nchest at the bottom, and that he had seen it.', 'sometimes it would come\\nfloating up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it would go back\\ninto deep water and disappear.', 'i was pleased to hear of the old log\\ncanoe, which took the place of an indian one of the same material but\\nmore graceful construction, which perchance had first been a tree on the\\nbank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float there for a\\ngeneration, the most proper vessel for the lake.', 'i remember that when i\\nfirst looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen\\nindistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been blown over\\nformerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood was cheaper;\\nbut now they have mostly disappeared.', 'when i first paddled a boat on walden, it was completely surrounded by\\nthick and lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape-vines\\nhad run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under which a\\nboat could pass.', 'the hills which form its shores are so steep, and the\\nwoods on them were then so high, that, as you looked down from the west\\nend, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some land of sylvan\\nspectacle.', 'i have spent many an hour, when i was younger, floating over\\nits surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle,\\nand lying on my back across the seats, in a summer forenoon, dreaming\\nawake, until i was aroused by the boat touching the sand, and i arose to\\nsee what shore my fates had impelled me to; days when idleness was the\\nmost attractive and productive industry.', \"many a forenoon have i stolen\\naway, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day; for i\\nwas rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent\\nthem lavishly; nor do i regret that i did not waste more of them in\\nthe workshop or the teacher's desk.\", 'but since i left those shores the\\nwoodchoppers have still further laid them waste, and now for many a\\nyear there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood,\\nwith occasional vistas through which you see the water.', 'my muse may be\\nexcused if she is silent henceforth.', 'how can you expect the birds to\\nsing when their groves are cut down?', 'now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the\\ndark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know\\nwhere it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are\\nthinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the ganges\\nat least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!--to\\nearn their walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug!', 'that\\ndevilish iron horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the\\ntown, has muddied the boiling spring with his foot, and he it is that\\nhas browsed off all the woods on walden shore, that trojan horse, with a\\nthousand

'though the woodchoppers have laid bare first\\nthis shore and then that, and the irish have built their sties by it,\\nand the railroad has infringed on its border, and the ice-men have\\nskimmed it

young, and\\ni may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its\\nsurface as of yore.', 'it struck me again tonight, as if i had not seen it\\nalmost daily for more than twenty years--why, here is walden, the same\\nwoodland lake that i discovered so many years ago; where a forest was\\ncut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as\\never; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it\\nis the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its maker, ay, and it\\nmay be to me.', 'it is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no\\nguile!', 'he rounded this water with his hand, deepened and clarified it in\\nhis thought, and in his will bequeathed it to concord.', 'i see by its face\\nthat it is visited by the same

on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one\\nof his feelers near the root, having already caused the other to go by\\nthe board; while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side,\\nand, as i saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of\\nhis members.\", 'they fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs.', 'neither\\nmanifested the least disposition to retreat.', 'it was evident that their\\nbattle-cry was \"conquer or die.\"', 'in the meanwhile there came along\\na single red ant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of\\nexcitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part\\nin the battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs;\\nwhose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it.', 'or\\nperchance he was some achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and\\nhad now come to avenge or rescue his patroclus.', 'he saw this unequal\\ncombat from afar--for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the\\nred--he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half\\nan inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang\\nupon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of\\nhis right fore leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and\\nso there were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had\\nbeen invented which put all other locks and cements to shame.', 'i should\\nnot have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective\\nmusical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national\\nairs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants.', 'i was\\nmyself excited somewhat even as if they had been men.', 'the more you think\\nof it, the less the

memorable to those whom\\nit concerns as those of the battle of bunker hill, at least.', 'i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly described were\\nstruggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a tumbler on\\nmy window-sill, in order to see the issue.', \"holding a microscope to the\\nfirst-mentioned red ant, i saw that, though he was assiduously gnawing\\nat the near fore leg of his enemy, having severed his remaining feeler,\\nhis own breast was all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there\\nto the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate was apparently too\\nthick for him to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of the sufferer's eyes\\nshone with ferocity such as war only could excite.\", 'they struggled half\\nan hour longer under the tumbler, and when i looked again the black\\nsoldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies, and the\\nstill living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly\\ntrophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as ever,\\nand he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being without feelers and\\nwith only the remnant of a leg, and i know not how many other wounds,\\nto divest himself of them; which at length, after half an hour more, he\\naccomplished.', 'i raised the glass, and he went off over the window-sill\\nin that crippled state.', 'whether he finally survived that combat, and\\nspent the remainder of his days in some hotel des invalides, i do\\nnot know; but i thought that his industry would not be worth much\\nthereafter.', 'i never learned which party was victorious, nor the cause of\\nthe war; but i felt for the rest of that day as if i had had my feelings\\nexcited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and\\ncarnage, of a human battle before my door.', 'kirby and spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been\\ncelebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that huber\\nis the

cat with young kittens in the woods, quite wild, and they\\nall, like their mother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at\\nme.', 'a few years before i lived in the woods there was what was called a\\n\"winged cat\" in one of the farm-houses in lincoln nearest the pond, mr.\\ngilian baker\\'s.', 'when i called to see her in june, 1842, she was gone\\na-hunting in the woods, as was her wont (i am not sure whether it was\\na male or female, and so use the more common pronoun), but her mistress\\ntold me that she came into the neighborhood a little more than a year\\nbefore, in april,

fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten\\nor twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like\\na muff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the\\nspring these appendages dropped off.', 'they gave me a pair of her \"wings,\"\\nwhich i keep still.', 'there is no appearance of a membrane about them.', 'some thought it was part flying

and\\nbathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter before i\\nhad risen.', 'at rumor of his arrival all the mill-dam sportsmen are on the\\nalert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent\\nrifles and conical balls and spy-glasses.', 'they come rustling through\\nthe woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one loon.', 'some station\\nthemselves on this side of the pond, some on that, for the poor bird\\ncannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there.', 'but\\nnow the kind october wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the\\nsurface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though his\\nfoes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound with\\ntheir discharges.', 'the waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking\\nsides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town\\nand shop and unfinished jobs.', 'but they were too often successful.', 'when\\ni went to get a pail of water early in the morning i frequently saw this\\nstately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods.', 'if i endeavored\\nto overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would manoeuvre, he\\nwould dive and be completely lost, so that i did not discover him again,\\nsometimes, till the latter part of the day.', 'but i was more than a match\\nfor him on the surface.', 'he commonly went off in a rain.', 'as i was paddling along the north shore one very calm october afternoon,\\nfor such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed\\ndown, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly one,\\nsailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me,\\nset up his wild laugh and betrayed himself.', 'i pursued with a paddle and\\nhe dived, but when he came up i was nearer than before.', 'he dived again,\\nbut i miscalculated the direction he would take, and we were fifty rods\\napart when he came to the surface this time, for i had helped to widen\\nthe interval; and again he laughed long and loud, and with more reason\\nthan before.', 'he manoeuvred so cunningly that i could not get within half\\na dozen rods of him.', 'each time, when he came to the surface, turning his\\nhead this way and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land, and\\napparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the\\nwidest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat.', 'it\\nwas surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into\\nexecution.', 'he led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could\\nnot be driven from it.', 'while he was thinking one thing in his brain,\\ni was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine.', 'it was a pretty game,\\nplayed on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon.', \"suddenly\\nyour adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem\\nis to place yours nearest to where his will appear again.\", 'sometimes he\\nwould come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having\\napparently passed directly under the boat.', 'so long-winded was he and so\\nunweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge\\nagain, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep\\npond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a\\nfish, for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in\\nits deepest part.', 'it is said that loons have been caught in the new york\\nlakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout--though\\nwalden is deeper than that.', 'how surprised must the fishes be to see\\nthis ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their\\nschools!', 'yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on\\nthe surface, and swam much faster there.', 'once or twice i saw a ripple\\nwhere he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,\\nand instantly dived again.', 'i found that it was as well for me to rest\\non my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he\\nwould rise; for again and again, when i was straining my eyes over the\\nsurface one way, i would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh\\nbehind me.', 'but why, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably\\nbetray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?', 'did not his\\nwhite breast enough betray him?', 'he was indeed a silly loon, i thought.', 'i\\ncould commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up, and so also\\ndetected him.', 'but after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as\\nwillingly, and swam yet farther than at first.', 'it was surprising to see\\nhow serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the\\nsurface, doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath.', 'his usual note\\nwas this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl; but\\noccasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long\\nway off, he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that\\nof a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground\\nand deliberately howls.', 'this was his looning--perhaps the wildest sound\\nthat is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide.', 'i concluded\\nthat he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own\\nresources.', 'though the sky was by this time overcast, the pond was so\\nsmooth that i could see where he broke the surface when i did not hear\\nhim.', 'his white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of\\nthe water were all against him.', 'at length having come up fifty rods off,\\nhe uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of\\nloons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from the east and\\nrippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and i was\\nimpressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was\\nangry with me; and so i left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous\\nsurface.', 'for hours, in fall days, i watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and\\nhold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which they\\nwill have less need to practise in louisiana bayous.', 'when compelled to\\nrise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a\\nconsiderable height, from which they could easily see to other ponds\\nand the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when i thought they had\\ngone off thither long since, they would settle down by a slanting flight\\nof a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free; but\\nwhat beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of walden i do not\\nknow, unless they love its water for the same reason that i do.', 'house-warming\\n\\n\\nin october i went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself with\\nclusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food.', 'there, too, i admired, though i did not gather, the cranberries, small\\nwaxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which the\\nfarmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl,\\nheedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and sells\\nthe spoils of the meads to boston and new york; destined to be jammed,\\nto satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there.', 'so butchers rake the\\ntongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the torn and\\ndrooping plant.', \"the barberry's brilliant fruit was likewise food for my\\neyes merely; but i collected a small store of wild apples for coddling,\\nwhich the proprietor and travellers had overlooked.\", 'when chestnuts were\\nripe i laid up half a bushel for winter.',

with in my hand, for i did not always wait for\\nthe frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red\\nsquirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts i sometimes stole,\\nfor the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones.', 'occasionally i climbed and shook the trees.', 'they grew also behind my\\nhouse, and one large tree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when\\nin flower, a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood, but the\\nsquirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last coming in flocks\\nearly in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burs before they\\nfell, i relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant\\nwoods composed wholly of chestnut.', 'these nuts, as far as they went, were\\na good substitute for bread.', 'many other substitutes might, perhaps, be\\nfound.', 'digging one day for fishworms, i discovered the ground-nut\\n(apios tuberosa) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort of\\nfabulous fruit, which i had begun to doubt if i had ever dug and eaten\\nin childhood, as i had told, and had not dreamed it.', 'i had often since\\nseen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other\\nplants without knowing it to be the same.', 'cultivation has well-nigh\\nexterminated it.', 'it has a sweetish taste, much like that of a\\nfrost-bitten potato, and i found it better boiled than roasted.', 'this\\ntuber seemed like a faint promise of nature to rear her own children\\nand feed them simply here at some future period.', \"in these days of fatted\\ncattle and waving grain-fields this humble root, which was once the\\ntotem of an indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or known only by its\\nflowering vine; but let wild nature reign here once

cornfield of the indian's god in the\\nsouthwest, whence he is said to have brought it; but the now almost\\nexterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of\\nfrosts and wildness,

felt complimented by their regarding my\\nhouse as a desirable shelter.', 'they never molested me seriously, though\\nthey bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices\\ni do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.', 'like the wasps, before i finally went into winter quarters in november,\\ni used to resort to the northeast side of walden, which the sun,\\nreflected from the pitch pine woods and the stony shore, made the\\nfireside of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be\\nwarmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire.', 'i

formed, as i could see\\ndistinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.', 'but as the last two\\ndays had been very warm, like an indian summer, the ice was not now\\ntransparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom,\\nbut opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly\\nstronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under\\nthis heat and run together, and lost their regularity; they were no\\nlonger one directly over another, but often like silvery coins poured\\nfrom a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as if occupying\\nslight cleavages.', 'the beauty of the ice was gone, and it was too late to\\nstudy the bottom.', 'being curious to know what position my great bubbles\\noccupied with regard to the new ice, i broke out a cake containing a\\nmiddling sized one, and turned it bottom upward.', 'the new ice had formed\\naround and under the bubble, so that it was included between the two\\nices.', 'it was wholly in the lower ice, but close against the upper, and\\nwas flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a\\nquarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and i was surprised\\nto find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great\\nregularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the height of five\\neighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin partition there between\\nthe water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick; and in many\\nplaces the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and\\nprobably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a\\nfoot in diameter.', 'i inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles\\nwhich i had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now\\nfrozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like\\na burning-glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it.', 'these are the\\nlittle air-guns which contribute to make the ice

the foxes as they ranged over the snow-crust, in\\nmoonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking\\nraggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some\\nanxiety,

way, but never getting on more\\nthan half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous\\nexpression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in the universe\\nwere eyed on him--for all the motions of a squirrel, even in the most\\nsolitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much as those of a\\ndancing girl--wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would\\nhave sufficed to walk the whole distance--i never saw one walk--and then\\nsuddenly, before you could say jack robinson, he would be in the top\\nof a young pitch pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary\\nspectators, soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same\\ntime--for no reason that i could ever detect, or he himself was aware\\nof, i suspect.', 'at length he would reach the corn, and selecting a\\nsuitable ear, frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to\\nthe topmost stick of my wood-pile, before my window, where he looked me\\nin the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a new\\near from time to time, nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the\\nhalf-naked cobs about; till at length he grew more dainty still and\\nplayed with his food, tasting only the inside of the kernel, and the\\near, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw, slipped from\\nhis careless grasp and fell to the ground, when he would look over at it\\nwith a ludicrous expression of uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had\\nlife, with a mind not made up whether to get it again, or a new one,\\nor be off; now thinking of corn, then listening to hear what was in\\nthe wind.', 'so the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in\\na forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer and plumper one,\\nconsiderably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he would\\nset out with it to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same\\nzig-zag course and frequent pauses, scratching along with it as if it\\nwere too heavy for him and falling all the while, making its fall a\\ndiagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal, being determined to\\nput it through at any rate;--a singularly frivolous and whimsical\\nfellow;--and so he would get off with it to where he lived, perhaps\\ncarry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant, and\\ni would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various\\ndirections.', 'at length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long\\nbefore, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile\\noff, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree,\\nnearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have\\ndropped.', 'then, sitting on a pitch pine bough, they attempt to swallow in\\ntheir haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes\\nthem; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in\\nthe endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills.', 'they\\nwere manifestly thieves, and i had not much respect for them; but the\\nsquirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking what\\nwas their own.', 'meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the\\ncrumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig and, placing\\nthem under their claws, hammered away at them with their little bills,\\nas if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced\\nfor their slender throats.', 'a little flock of these titmice came daily to\\npick a dinner out of my woodpile, or the crumbs at my door, with faint\\nflitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles in the grass, or\\nelse with sprightly day day day, or more rarely, in spring-like days,\\na wiry summery

of\\nwinter, when the snow was melted on my south hillside and about my\\nwood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to\\nfeed there.', 'whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts\\naway on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs\\non high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for\\nthis brave bird is not to be scared by winter.', 'it is frequently covered\\nup by drifts, and, it is said, \"sometimes plunges from on wing into the\\nsoft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two.\"', 'i used to

stops to rest and listen till\\nthey come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where\\nthe hunters await him.', 'sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many\\nrods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to know that\\nwater will not retain his scent.', 'a hunter told me that he once saw a fox\\npursued by hounds burst out on to walden when the ice was covered with\\nshallow puddles, run part way across, and then return to the same shore.', 'ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the scent.', 'sometimes\\na pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and circle round my\\nhouse, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if afflicted by a\\nspecies of madness, so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit.', 'thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox, for a\\nwise hound will forsake everything else for this.', 'one day a man came\\nto my hut from lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large\\ntrack, and had been hunting for a week by himself.', 'but i fear that he\\nwas not the wiser for all i told him, for every time i attempted to\\nanswer his questions he interrupted me by asking, \"what do you do here?\"', 'he had lost a dog, but found a man.', 'one old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in walden\\nonce every year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in\\nupon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and\\nwent out for a cruise in walden wood; and as he walked the wayland road\\nhe heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a fox leaped the\\nwall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of\\nthe road, and his swift bullet had not touched him.', 'some way behind came\\nan old hound and her three pups in full pursuit, hunting on their own\\naccount, and disappeared again in the woods.', 'late in the afternoon, as\\nhe was resting in the thick woods south of walden, he heard the voice\\nof the hounds far over toward fair haven still pursuing the fox; and\\non they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding\\nnearer and nearer, now from well meadow, now from the baker farm.', \"for\\na long time he stood still and listened to their music, so sweet to\\na hunter's ear, when suddenly the fox appeared, threading the solemn\\naisles with an easy coursing pace, whose sound was concealed by a\\nsympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and still, keeping the round,\\nleaving his pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the\\nwoods, he sat erect and listening, with his back to the hunter.\", \"for\\na moment compassion restrained the latter's arm; but that was a\\nshort-lived mood, and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece\\nwas levelled, and whang!--the fox, rolling over the rock, lay dead on\\nthe ground.\", 'the hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds.', 'still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all their\\naisles with their demoniac cry.', 'at length the old hound burst into view\\nwith muzzle to the ground, and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran\\ndirectly to the rock; but, spying the dead fox, she suddenly ceased her\\nhounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and round\\nhim in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother,\\nwere sobered into silence by the mystery.', 'then the hunter came forward\\nand stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved.', 'they waited in\\nsilence while he skinned the fox, then

his hounds\\nthat night, but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and\\nput up at a farmhouse for the night, whence, having been well fed, they\\ntook their departure early in the morning.', 'the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting, who used\\nto hunt bears on fair haven ledges, and exchange their skins for rum\\nin concord village; who told him, even, that

the scale\\nof being are filled.', 'when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amused\\nby the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted.', 'he would\\nperhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice,\\nwhich were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore,\\nand having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being\\npulled through, have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder, a\\nfoot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it, which, being\\npulled down, would show when he had a bite.',

precious stones, as if they were the pearls, the animalized\\nnuclei or crystals of the walden water.', 'they, of course, are walden\\nall over and all through; are themselves small waldens in the animal\\nkingdom, waldenses.', 'it is surprising that they are caught here--that\\nin this deep and capacious spring, far beneath the rattling teams and\\nchaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden road, this great\\ngold and emerald fish swims.', 'i never chanced to see its kind in any\\nmarket; it would be the cynosure of all eyes there.', 'easily, with a\\nfew convulsive quirks, they

foundation for themselves.', 'it is remarkable how long men will believe\\nin the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound\\nit.', 'i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in this\\nneighborhood.', 'many have believed that walden reached quite through to\\nthe other side of the globe.', 'some who have lain flat on the ice for\\na long time, looking down through the illusive medium, perchance with\\nwatery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by the\\nfear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes \"into which\\na load of hay might be driven,\" if there were anybody to drive it, the\\nundoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernal regions from\\nthese parts.', 'others have gone down from the village with a \"fifty-six\"\\nand a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to find any bottom;\\nfor while the \"fifty-six\" was resting by the way, they were paying out\\nthe rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity\\nfor marvellousness.', 'but i can assure my readers that walden has a\\nreasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though at an unusual,\\ndepth.', 'i fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about\\na pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the stone left the\\nbottom, by having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath\\nto help me.', 'the greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet; to\\nwhich may be added the five feet which it has risen since, making one\\nhundred and seven.', 'this is a remarkable depth for so small an area; yet\\nnot an inch of it can be spared by the imagination.', 'what if all ponds\\nwere shallow?', 'would it not react on the minds of men?', 'i am thankful that\\nthis pond was made deep and pure for a symbol.', 'while men believe in the\\ninfinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless.', 'a factory-owner, hearing what depth i had found, thought that it could\\nnot be true, for, judging from his acquaintance with dams, sand would\\nnot lie at so steep an angle.', 'but the deepest ponds are not so deep in\\nproportion to their area as most suppose, and, if drained, would not\\nleave very remarkable valleys.', 'they are not like cups between the hills;\\nfor this one, which is so unusually deep for its area, appears in a\\nvertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow plate.', 'most ponds, emptied, would leave a meadow no more hollow than we\\nfrequently see.', 'william gilpin, who is so admirable in all that relates\\nto landscapes, and usually so correct, standing at the head of loch\\nfyne, in scotland, which he describes as \"a bay of salt water, sixty\\nor seventy fathoms deep, four miles in breadth,\" and about fifty miles\\nlong, surrounded by mountains, observes, \"if we could have seen it\\nimmediately after the diluvian crash, or whatever convulsion of nature\\noccasioned it, before

of waters.\"', 'but if, using the shortest diameter of loch fyne, we apply these\\nproportions to walden, which, as we have seen, appears already in a\\nvertical section only like a shallow plate, it will appear four times\\nas shallow.', 'so much for the increased horrors of the chasm of loch\\nfyne when emptied.', 'no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching\\ncornfields occupies exactly such a \"horrid chasm,\" from which the waters\\nhave receded, though it requires the insight and the far sight of the\\ngeologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact.', 'often\\nan inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the\\nlow horizon hills, and no subsequent elevation of the plain have been\\nnecessary to conceal their history.', 'but it is easiest, as they who work\\non the highways know, to find the hollows by the puddles after a shower.', 'the amount of it is, the imagination give it the least license, dives\\ndeeper and soars higher than nature goes.', 'so, probably, the depth of the\\nocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth.', 'as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottom\\nwith greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do\\nnot freeze over, and i was surprised at its general regularity.', 'in the\\ndeepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field\\nwhich is exposed to the sun, wind, and plow.', 'in one instance, on a line\\narbitrarily chosen, the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty\\nrods; and generally, near the middle, i could calculate the variation\\nfor each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or\\nfour inches.', 'some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes\\neven in quiet sandy ponds like this, but the effect of water under these\\ncircumstances is to level all inequalities.', 'the regularity of the bottom\\nand its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring\\nhills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the\\nsoundings quite across the pond, and its direction could be determined\\nby observing the opposite shore.', 'cape becomes bar, and plain shoal, and\\nvalley and gorge deep water and channel.', 'when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and\\nput down the soundings, more than a hundred in all, i observed this\\nremarkable coincidence.', 'having noticed that the number indicating the\\ngreatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map, i laid a rule\\non the map lengthwise, and then breadthwise, and found, to my surprise,\\nthat the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest\\nbreadth exactly at the point of greatest depth, notwithstanding that the\\nmiddle is so nearly level, the outline of the pond far from regular, and\\nthe extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into the coves; and\\ni said to myself, who knows but this hint would conduct to the deepest\\npart of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle?', 'is not this the rule\\nalso for the height of mountains, regarded as the opposite of valleys?', 'we know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part.', 'of five coves, three, or all which had been sounded, were observed to\\nhave a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within, so that\\nthe bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only\\nhorizontally but vertically, and to form a basin or independent pond,\\nthe direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar.', 'every\\nharbor on the sea-coast, also, has its bar at its entrance.', 'in\\nproportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length,\\nthe water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin.', 'given, then, the length and breadth of the cove, and the character of\\nthe surrounding shore, and you have almost elements enough to make out a\\nformula for all cases.', 'in order to see how nearly i could guess, with this experience, at the\\ndeepest point in a pond, by observing the outlines of a surface and\\nthe character of its shores alone, i made a plan of white pond, which\\ncontains about forty-one acres, and, like this, has no island in it, nor\\nany visible inlet or outlet; and as the line of greatest breadth fell\\nvery near the line of least breadth, where two opposite capes approached\\neach other and two opposite bays receded, i ventured to mark a point a\\nshort distance from the latter line, but still on the line of greatest\\nlength, as the deepest.', 'the deepest part was found to be within one\\nhundred feet of this, still farther in the direction to which i had\\ninclined, and was only one foot deeper, namely, sixty feet.', 'of course, a\\nstream running through, or an island in the pond, would make the problem\\nmuch more complicated.', 'if we knew all the laws of nature, we should need only one fact, or\\nthe description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular\\nresults at that point.', 'now we know only a few laws, and our result is\\nvitiated, not, of course, by any confusion or irregularity in nature,\\nbut by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation.', 'our\\nnotions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances\\nwhich we detect; but the harmony which results from a far greater number\\nof seemingly conflicting, but really concurring, laws, which we have not\\ndetected, is still more wonderful.', 'the particular laws are as our points\\nof view, as, to the traveller, a mountain outline varies with every\\nstep, and it has an infinite number of profiles, though absolutely but\\none form.', 'even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its\\nentireness.', 'what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics.', 'it is the\\nlaw of average.', \"such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us\\ntoward the sun in the system and the heart in man, but draws lines\\nthrough the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man's particular\\ndaily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets, and where\\nthey intersect will be the height or depth of his character.\", 'perhaps\\nwe need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country\\nor circumstances, to infer his depth and concealed bottom.', 'if he is\\nsurrounded by mountainous circumstances, an achillean shore, whose peaks\\novershadow and are reflected in his bosom, they suggest a corresponding\\ndepth in him.', 'but a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that\\nside.', 'in our bodies, a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a\\ncorresponding depth of thought.', 'also there is a bar across the entrance\\nof our every cove, or particular inclination; each is our harbor for\\na season, in which we are detained and partially land-locked.', 'these\\ninclinations are not whimsical usually, but their form, size, and\\ndirection are determined by the promontories of the shore, the ancient\\naxes of elevation.', 'when this bar is gradually increased by storms,\\ntides, or currents, or there is a subsidence of the waters, so that it\\nreaches to the surface, that which was at first but an inclination in\\nthe shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual\\nlake, cut off from the ocean, wherein the thought secures its own\\nconditions--changes, perhaps, from salt to fresh, becomes a sweet sea,\\ndead sea, or a marsh.', 'at the advent of each individual into this life,\\nmay we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere?', 'it is true, we are such poor navigators that our thoughts, for the most\\npart, stand off and on upon a harborless coast, are conversant only with\\nthe bights of the bays of poesy, or steer for the public ports of entry,\\nand go into the dry docks of science, where they merely refit for this\\nworld, and no natural currents concur to individualize them.', 'as for the inlet or outlet of walden, i have not discovered any but rain\\nand snow and evaporation, though perhaps, with a thermometer and a line,\\nsuch places may be found, for where the water flows into the pond it\\nwill probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter.', \"when the\\nice-men were at work here in '46-7, the cakes sent to the shore were one\\nday rejected by those who were stacking them up there, not being\\nthick enough to lie side by side with the rest; and the cutters thus\\ndiscovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches\\nthinner than elsewhere, which made them think that there was an inlet\\nthere.\", 'they also showed me in another place what they thought was a\\n\"leach-hole,\" through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a\\nneighboring meadow, pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it.', 'it was a\\nsmall cavity under ten feet of water; but i think that i can warrant the\\npond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that.', 'one has suggested, that if such a \"leach-hole\" should be found, its\\nconnection with the meadow, if any existed, might be proved by conveying\\nsome, colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole, and then\\nputting a strainer over the spring in the meadow, which would catch some\\nof the particles carried through by the current.', 'while i was surveying, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick,\\nundulated under a slight wind like water.', 'it is well known that a\\nlevel cannot be used on ice.', 'at one rod from the shore its greatest\\nfluctuation, when observed by means of a level on land directed toward\\na graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters of an inch, though the\\nice appeared firmly attached to the shore.', 'it was probably greater in\\nthe middle.', 'who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we\\nmight detect an undulation in the crust of the earth?', 'when two legs of\\nmy level were on the shore and the third on the ice, and the sights\\nwere directed over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an almost\\ninfinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across\\nthe pond.', 'when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three or\\nfour inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it\\nthus far; but the water began immediately to run into these holes, and\\ncontinued to run for two days in deep streams, which wore away the ice\\non every side, and contributed essentially, if not mainly, to dry the\\nsurface of the pond; for, as the water ran in, it raised and floated the\\nice.', 'this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to\\nlet the water out.', \"when such holes freeze, and a rain succeeds,\\nand finally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all, it is\\nbeautifully mottled internally by dark figures, shaped somewhat like a\\nspider's web, what you may call ice rosettes, produced by the channels\\nworn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre.\", 'sometimes, also,\\nwhen the ice was covered with shallow puddles, i saw a double shadow of\\nmyself, one standing on the head of the other, one on the ice, the other\\non the trees or hillside.', 'while yet it is cold january, and snow and ice are thick and solid, the\\nprudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer\\ndrink; impressively, even pathetically, wise, to foresee the heat and\\nthirst of july now in january--wearing a thick coat and mittens!', 'when so\\nmany things are not provided for.', 'it may be that he lays up no treasures\\nin this world which will cool his summer drink in the next.', 'he cuts and\\nsaws the solid pond, unroofs the house of fishes, and carts off their\\nvery element and air, held fast by

streets.', 'these ice-cutters are a merry race, full of jest\\nand sport, and when i went among them they were wont to invite me to saw\\npit-fashion with them, i standing underneath.', \"in the winter of '46-7 there came a hundred men of hyperborean\\nextraction swoop down on to our pond one morning, with many carloads\\nof ungainly-looking farming tools--sleds, plows, drill-barrows,\\nturf-knives, spades, saws, rakes, and each man was armed with a\\ndouble-pointed pike-staff, such as is not described in the new-england\\nfarmer or the cultivator.\", 'i did not know whether they had come to sow a\\ncrop of winter rye, or some other kind of grain recently introduced from\\niceland.', 'as i saw no manure, i judged that they meant to skim the land,\\nas i had done, thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long\\nenough.', 'they said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the scenes,\\nwanted to double his money, which, as i understood, amounted to half\\na million already; but in order to cover each one of his dollars with\\nanother, he took off the only coat, ay, the skin itself, of walden\\npond in the midst of a hard winter.', 'they went to work at once, plowing,\\nbarrowing, rolling, furrowing, in admirable order, as if they were bent\\non making this a model farm; but when i was looking sharp to see what\\nkind of seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang of fellows by my side\\nsuddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself, with a peculiar jerk,\\nclean down to the sand, or rather the water--for it was a very springy\\nsoil--indeed all the terra firma there was--and haul it away on sleds,\\nand then i guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog.', 'so they came\\nand went every day, with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive, from and\\nto some point of the polar regions, as it seemed to me, like a flock\\nof arctic snow-birds.', 'but sometimes squaw walden had her revenge, and\\na hired man, walking behind his team, slipped through a crack in the\\nground down toward tartarus, and he who was so brave before suddenly\\nbecame but the ninth part of a man, almost gave up his animal heat, and\\nwas glad to take refuge in my house, and acknowledged that there was\\nsome virtue in a stove; or sometimes the frozen soil took a piece of\\nsteel out of a plowshare, or a plow got set in the furrow and had to be\\ncut out.', 'to speak literally, a hundred irishmen, with yankee overseers, came from\\ncambridge every day to get out the ice.', 'they divided it into cakes by\\nmethods too well known to require description, and these, being sledded\\nto the shore, were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform, and raised\\nby grappling irons and block and tackle, worked by horses, on to a\\nstack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and there placed evenly\\nside by side, and row upon row, as if they formed the solid base of an\\nobelisk designed to pierce the clouds.', 'they told me that in a good day\\nthey could get out a thousand tons, which was the yield of about one\\nacre.', 'deep ruts and \"cradle-holes\" were worn in the ice, as on terra\\nfirma, by the passage of the sleds over the same track, and the horses\\ninvariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets.', 'they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirty-five\\nfeet high on one side and six or seven rods square, putting hay between\\nthe outside layers to exclude the air; for when the wind, though never\\nso cold, finds a passage through, it will wear large cavities, leaving\\nslight supports or studs only here and there, and finally topple it\\ndown.', 'at first it looked like a vast blue fort or valhalla; but when\\nthey began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the crevices, and this\\nbecame covered with rime and icicles, it looked like a venerable\\nmoss-grown and hoary ruin, built of azure-tinted marble, the abode of\\nwinter, that old man we see in the almanac--his shanty, as if he had\\na design to estivate with us.', 'they calculated that not twenty-five per\\ncent of this would reach its destination, and that two or three per cent\\nwould be wasted in the cars.', 'however, a still greater part of this heap\\nhad a different destiny from what was intended; for, either because the\\nice was found not to keep so well as was expected, containing more air\\nthan usual, or for some other reason, it never got to market.', \"this heap,\\nmade in the winter of '46-7 and estimated to contain ten thousand tons,\\nwas finally covered with hay and boards; and though it was unroofed the\\nfollowing july, and a part of it carried off, the rest remaining exposed\\nto the sun, it stood over that summer and the next winter, and was not\\nquite melted till september, 1848. thus the pond recovered the greater\\npart.\", 'like the water, the walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but\\nat a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the\\nwhite ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a\\nquarter of a mile off.', \"sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the\\nice-man's sled into the village street, and lies there for a week like a\\ngreat emerald, an object of interest to all passers.\", 'i have noticed that\\na portion of walden which in the state of water was green will often,\\nwhen frozen, appear from the same point of view blue.', 'so the hollows\\nabout this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be filled with a\\ngreenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have frozen\\nblue.', 'perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and\\nair they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest.', 'ice is an\\ninteresting subject for contemplation.', 'they told me that they had some\\nin the ice-houses at fresh pond five years old which was as good as\\never.', 'why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid, but frozen\\nremains sweet forever?', 'it is commonly said that this is the difference\\nbetween the affections and the intellect.', 'thus for sixteen days i saw from my window a hundred men at work like\\nbusy husbandmen, with teams and horses and apparently all the implements\\nof farming, such a picture as we see on the first page of the almanac;\\nand as often as i looked out i was reminded of the fable of the lark and\\nthe reapers, or the parable of the sower, and the like; and now they are\\nall gone, and in thirty days more, probably, i shall look from the same\\nwindow on the pure sea-green walden water there, reflecting the clouds\\nand the trees, and sending up its evaporations in solitude, and no\\ntraces will appear that a man has ever stood there.', 'perhaps i shall hear\\na solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes himself, or shall see a\\nlonely fisher in his boat, like a floating leaf, beholding his form\\nreflected in the waves, where lately a hundred men securely labored.', 'thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of charleston and new\\norleans, of madras and bombay and calcutta, drink at my well.', 'in the\\nmorning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy\\nof the bhagvat-geeta, since whose composition years of the gods\\nhave elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its\\nliterature seem puny and trivial; and i doubt if that philosophy is\\nnot to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its\\nsublimity from our conceptions.', 'i lay down the book and go to my well\\nfor water, and lo!', 'there i meet the servant of the bramin, priest of\\nbrahma and vishnu and indra, who still sits in his temple on the ganges\\nreading the vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and\\nwater jug.', 'i meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and\\nour buckets as it were grate together in the same well.', 'the pure walden\\nwater is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges.', 'with favoring\\nwinds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of atlantis and\\nthe hesperides, makes the periplus of hanno, and, floating by ternate\\nand tidore and the mouth of the persian gulf, melts in the tropic gales\\nof the indian seas, and is landed in ports of which alexander only heard\\nthe names.', 'spring\\n\\n\\nthe opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond\\nto break up earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold\\nweather, wears away the surrounding ice.', 'but such was not the effect on\\nwalden that year, for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the\\nplace of the old.', 'this pond never breaks up so soon as the others in\\nthis neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having\\nno stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice.', \"i never knew\\nit to open in the course of a winter, not excepting that of '52-3, which\\ngave the ponds so severe a trial.\", \"it commonly opens about the first\\nof april, a week or ten days later than flint's pond and fair haven,\\nbeginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where\\nit began to freeze.\", 'it indicates better than any water hereabouts the\\nabsolute progress of the season, being least affected by transient\\nchanges of temperature.', 'a severe cold of a few days duration in\\nmarch may very much retard the opening of the former ponds, while the\\ntemperature of walden increases almost uninterruptedly.', \"a thermometer\\nthrust into the middle of walden on the 6th of march, 1847, stood at\\n32x, or freezing point; near the shore at 33x; in the middle of flint's\\npond, the same day, at 32+x; at a dozen rods from the shore, in shallow\\nwater, under ice a foot thick, at 36x.\", 'this difference of three and a\\nhalf degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow\\nin the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of it is\\ncomparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner than\\nwalden.', 'the ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches\\nthinner than in the middle.', 'in midwinter the middle had been the warmest\\nand the ice thinnest there.', 'so, also, every one who has waded about the\\nshores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the\\nwater is close to the shore, where only three or four inches deep, than\\na little distance out, and on the surface where it is deep, than near\\nthe bottom.', 'in spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the\\nincreased temperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes through\\nice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from the bottom in shallow\\nwater, and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice,\\nat the same time that it is melting it more directly above, making\\nit uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend\\nthemselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed, and\\nat last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain.', 'ice has its grain\\nas well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot or \"comb,\" that is,\\nassume the appearance of honeycomb, whatever may be its position, the\\nair cells are at right angles with what was the water surface.', 'where\\nthere is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is\\nmuch thinner, and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat;\\nand i have been told that in the experiment at cambridge to freeze water\\nin a shallow wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and\\nso had access to both sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom\\nmore than counterbalanced this advantage.', 'when a warm rain in the middle\\nof the winter melts off the snow-ice from walden, and leaves a hard dark\\nor transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though\\nthicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by this\\nreflected heat.', 'also, as i have said, the bubbles themselves within the\\nice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.', 'the phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small\\nscale.', 'every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being\\nwarmed more rapidly than the deep, though it may not be made so warm\\nafter all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the\\nmorning.', 'the day is an epitome of the year.', 'the night is the winter, the\\nmorning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the summer.', 'the cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature.', \"one pleasant morning after a cold night, february 24th, 1850, having\\ngone to flint's pond to spend the day, i noticed with surprise, that\\nwhen i struck the ice with the head of my axe, it resounded like a gong\\nfor many rods around, or as if i had struck on a tight drum-head.\", \"the pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise, when it felt the\\ninfluence of the sun's rays slanted upon it from over the hills;\\nit stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually\\nincreasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours.\", 'it took a\\nshort siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the sun\\nwas withdrawing his influence.', 'in the right stage of the weather a pond\\nfires its evening gun with great regularity.', 'but in the middle of the\\nday, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it had\\ncompletely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats could\\nnot then have been stunned by a blow on it.', 'the fishermen say that the\\n\"thundering of the pond\" scares the fishes and prevents their biting.', 'the pond does not thunder every evening, and i cannot tell surely when\\nto expect its thundering; but though i may perceive no difference in\\nthe weather, it does.', 'who would have suspected so large and cold and\\nthick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive?', 'yet it has its law to which\\nit thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the\\nspring.', 'the earth is all alive and covered with papillae.', 'the largest\\npond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in\\nits tube.', 'one attraction in coming to the woods to live was that i should have\\nleisure and opportunity to see the spring come in.', 'the ice in the pond\\nat length begins to be honeycombed, and i can set my heel in it as i\\nwalk.', 'fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow; the\\ndays have grown sensibly longer; and i see how i shall get through the\\nwinter without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires are no longer\\nnecessary.', \"i am on the alert for the first signs of spring, to hear the\\nchance note of some arriving bird, or the striped squirrel's chirp, for\\nhis stores must be now nearly exhausted, or see the woodchuck venture\\nout of his winter quarters.\", 'on the 13th of march, after i had heard the\\nbluebird, song sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was still nearly a foot\\nthick.', 'as the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the\\nwater, nor broken up and floated off as in rivers, but, though it was\\ncompletely melted for half a rod in width about the shore, the middle\\nwas merely honeycombed and saturated with water, so that you could put\\nyour foot through it when six inches thick; but by the next day evening,\\nperhaps, after a warm rain followed by fog, it would have wholly\\ndisappeared, all gone off with the fog, spirited away.', 'one year i went\\nacross the middle only five days before it disappeared entirely.', \"in 1845\\nwalden was first completely open on the 1st of april; in '46, the

of ice remaining.', 'not seeing any ducks, he hid his boat on the\\nnorth or back side of an island in the pond, and then concealed himself\\nin the bushes on the south side, to await them.', 'the ice was melted for\\nthree or four rods from the shore, and there was a smooth and warm sheet\\nof water, with a muddy bottom, such as the ducks love, within, and he\\nthought it likely that some would be along pretty soon.', 'after he had\\nlain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant\\nsound, but singularly grand and impressive, unlike anything he had ever\\nheard, gradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal\\nand memorable ending, a sullen rush and roar, which seemed to him all\\nat once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there,\\nand, seizing his gun, he started up in haste and excited; but he found,\\nto his surprise, that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay\\nthere, and drifted in to the shore, and the sound he had heard was made\\nby its edge grating on the shore--at first gently nibbled and crumbled\\noff, but at length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island\\nto a

'you do not resist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves, thus\\nobstinately; you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities.', 'you\\ndo not put your head into the fire.', 'but just in proportion as i regard\\nthis as not wholly a brute force, but partly a human force, and consider\\nthat i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of\\nmen, and not of mere brute or inanimate things, i see that appeal is\\npossible, first and instantaneously, from them to the maker of\\nthem, and, secondly, from them to themselves.', 'but, if i put my head\\ndeliberately into the
